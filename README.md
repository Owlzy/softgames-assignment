# Softgames

3 tasks implemented, with caveat, while I use typescript for my backend, I am yet to migrate the frontend, so have used ES6 with the justification it seems more important to spend the time on the tasks rather than migrating the framework. Also, in task 1, I used projection meshes instead of sprites, as performance is comparable,and it's more fun to use a bit of 3d :)
